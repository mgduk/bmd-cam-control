# Blackmagic Camera Control

An unofficial app to give control of iris, shutter speed, gain/ISO, focus, etc on Blackmagic cameras via their HTTP API.

This allows you remote control of a camera from a phone, tablet or other device.

In combination with a portable router, such as the [GL.iNET GL-AR300M16](https://amzn.eu/d/7t6fbno), you can have wireless control with up to 100m outdoor range!

Currently tested on the [Blackmagic Micro Studio G2](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/uk/products/blackmagicmicrostudiocamera).
