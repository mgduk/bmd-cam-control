> should be requestMessage

if you set a shutter speed lower than the frame rate, the request returns 204 but the value isn't changed, and there's no websocket message

when changing the aperture stop, one or two websocket messages are immediately received with the _old_ value for apertureStop — sometimes (not always) another is received with the new value

YAML CORS headers

No websocket message sent sometimes when auto focusing — seemingly when the camera struggles to find focus

When connected to ATEM, changing the frame rate fails silently
